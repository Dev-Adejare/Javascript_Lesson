 Arrays are Objects => {}object in Array
Arrays are a special type of objects. The type of operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.

But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.

Arrays use numbers to access its "elements". In this example, person[0] returns John:


//ARRAY-PUSH =>The push() method returns the new array length:
//It add new element to the end of an ARRAY.

const students =['Yemi', 'Sola', 'Grace', 'Maryam', 'Femi','Bola'];
console.log(students);

const pushed = students.push('Babe', 'Kemi', 'Sola', 'Akin');
console.log(pushed);
console.log(students);

// POP METHOD => The pop() method removes the last element from an array
const numbers = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
console.log(numbers)

const popped = numbers.pop();
console.log(popped);
console.log(numbers);


const fruits = ['Mango', 'Cashew', 'Apple', 'Strawberry'];
console.log(fruits);

const poppe = fruits.pop();
console.log(poppe);
console.log(fruits);
