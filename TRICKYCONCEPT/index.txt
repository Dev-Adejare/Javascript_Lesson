Advantages & Disadvantages of TrickyConcepts.

GLOBAL Variables;
These are declared or designed inside a function are in the Global scope.

ADVANTAGES of using Global Variable;
=>Easy access from all the function in a program.
=> Used for storing constant.
=>It helps to keep consistency.
=> It's useful when multiple function are accessing the same data.

DISADVANTAGES;
=>Two many variables declare as Global, then they remain in the memory till program execution is completetd this can cause out of memory issue.
=> It may give unpredictable result in multitasking environment.
=>If Global variable are discontinue de to code refacturing, you'll need to change all the modules where they are called.

LOCAL_SCOPE;

ADVANTAGES;
=>Variables declared or designed inside a function are in the local scope.
=>It offer a guarrantee that the variable declared will remain intact while the task is running.
=>Deleted as soon as any function is over and release the memory space it occupied.

DISADVANTAGES;
=>They have a very limited scope.
