CLONING => Cloning objects in JavaScript is an essential skill for developers working with complex data structures or needing to create copies of objects for various reasons.

TECHNIQUES FOR CLONING OBJECTS IN JavaScript;

=>SHALLOW CLONING -> Shallow Cloning
Shallow cloning creates a new object that is a copy of the original object with a new reference.

=>DEEP CLONING -> Deep cloning, on the other hand, creates a new object that is an exact copy of the original object,
including all its properties and inner objects. This means that the new object and the original object are completely independent of each other, and changes made to one object will not affect the other.
